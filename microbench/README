Hi,

This is an *extremely* simple microbenchmark suite.

Its intended purpose is in the validation of general purpose out-of-order
cores, by targetting individual micro-architectural features or effects. 
Of course this is by no means an exhaustive collection of necessary bencharks
to test every mechanism in an OOO processor.  This is merely a starting point.

To use this, you should only need bash, make and python.

Configure the versions of the compiler and python (tested with python-2.7):
> vim make.config

To make the benchmarks:
> make

Clean the benchmarks:
> make clean

Describe basically what each benchmark is for:
> describe.sh

Run a benchmark: (no args on any current benchmark)
> cd CCa
> ./test

PS: Also, some benchmarks use an LFSR setting to get a particular working set.
Please see lfsr_settings.txt for example values. (bench ML2 uses this)
